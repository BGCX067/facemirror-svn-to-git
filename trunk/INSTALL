Prerequisite:

    libevent:
	http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/

	lex&yacc(flex&bison):
	  Linux distribution should have these tools.
	  Win32:
		http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/flex.htm
		http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/bison.htm

Install:
	
/face2cpp
	
	Face protocol 'compiler', require lex&yacc support. For Linux,
	with these 2 tools installed, go to /face2cpp directory:

	somebody@localhost theface/face2cpp$ make

	This will produce the utility 'face2cpp'

	Win32 version for face2cpp is not provided yet, but could be walk
	around easily with flex and bison windows version.

/libface

	Linux:

	Type 'make' in libface directory, be sure the libevent is
	installed into system.

	somebody@localhost theface/face2cpp$ make

	Windows:

	At 2008-01-16, the latest libevent port for WIN32 is version 1.1a,
	the Visual C++ library "libevent.lib" and "event.h" are both
	packed in the libface directory. Just use 'face.sln' to compile
	under Visual C++, this will produce face.lib for WIN32 environment.
